# üó≥Ô∏è Voting System Database Setup

## ‚úÖ What We Built

A **fully persistent, real-time voting system** for your family vacation planning app, connected to a **Neon PostgreSQL database**.

---

## üìä Database Schema

### `votes` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE votes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  voter_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  place_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(voter_name, place_id)  -- Prevents duplicate votes
);
```

### Indexes (for fast queries)
- `idx_votes_voter_name` - Fast lookup by voter
- `idx_votes_place_id` - Fast lookup by place
- `idx_votes_created_at` - Fast sorting by date

### Auto-Update Trigger
- `update_votes_updated_at` - Automatically updates `updated_at` on every change

---

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Via Web Browser
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Select your name
4. Click "Votar" on any place
5. Refresh the page - your votes persist! üéâ

### 2. Via Database (psql)
```bash
# Connect to database
psql "postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_7UgrBk5mRFzs@ep-muddy-base-adbun44p-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"

# View all votes
SELECT * FROM votes ORDER BY created_at DESC;

# Count votes per place
SELECT place_id, COUNT(*) as vote_count 
FROM votes 
GROUP BY place_id 
ORDER BY vote_count DESC;

# Count votes per person
SELECT voter_name, COUNT(*) as vote_count 
FROM votes 
GROUP BY voter_name 
ORDER BY voter_name;
```

### 3. Via API (curl)
```bash
# Get all votes
curl http://localhost:3000/api/votes

# Add a vote
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/votes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "voterName": "Jos√©",
    "placeId": "cancun__playas__playa-delfines",
    "action": "add"
  }'

# Remove a vote
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/votes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "voterName": "Jos√©",
    "placeId": "cancun__playas__playa-delfines",
    "action": "remove"
  }'
```

## üì¶ Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@neondatabase/serverless": "^0.x.x"  // Neon PostgreSQL driver
}
```

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/lib/db.ts` - Database connection and queries
- `src/app/api/votes/route.ts` - API endpoints for voting
- `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `src/app/vote-enhanced.js` - Updated to use database API
- `.env` - Contains database credentials (already existed)

---

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

When deploying to production (Vercel, etc.):

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set in your hosting platform
2. **Database Connection**: Neon serverless driver works perfectly on Vercel Edge Functions
3. **No Migration Needed**: Schema already created in production database

---

## üé® UI Improvements

- **Loading State**: Beautiful wave animation while fetching votes
- **Voting Feedback**: "Guardando..." spinner when saving votes
- **Disabled State**: Prevents double-clicking during save
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly alerts for any issues

---

## üîê Security Notes

- Database credentials in `.env` should NEVER be committed to git
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (should already be there)
- Use environment variables in production
- The UNIQUE constraint prevents vote manipulation

---

## üéâ What's Next?

Possible enhancements:
- [ ] Real-time sync with WebSockets
- [ ] Vote history and analytics dashboard
- [ ] Export votes to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Vote comments/reasons
- [ ] Vote deadlines
- [ ] Admin panel for managing voters
